when you have teo different variable names for a same string
the both variables act as appointers for the same string object.
whereas if you use new keyword to initialise  the same string there well be a new object 
formed Hence this new variable doesnt act as a pointer for the old string  but really 
points to the newly created string.
Why strings are immutable?
this is becoz 
Any change that u have made for a string actually creates a new string and the
pointer location is chaned to the new string location
This arises the need for the new data structure called String Builder.
